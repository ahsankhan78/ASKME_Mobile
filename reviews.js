 {"Id":2,"Name":"Chris Evans","Img":"1.jpg","Title":"APPLE IPHONE 12 PRO MAX","Para":"Is iPhone 12 Pro Max worth buying. If you're a budding movie-maker, we'd say it's definitely worth looking at the 12 Pro Max – it's packing Dolby Vision recording at 4K and 60 frames per second, so if you're a content creator looking for a phone that can record high-quality footage, the 12 Pro Max can definitely do that"}
